### 🧮 Core Operations

#### 1. **Dynamic Construction**

#### Example 1: Simple Construction

`A → B`  
Means A tends to B through a dynamic process. B is the generated output.

#### Example 2: Single Path Construction

`A → B → C → D`  
Means A tends to D and passes through B and C sequentially. D is the output.

#### Example 3: Multiple Path Construction

`A → B → D ∧ A → C → D`  
Means A tends to D but it goes through B and C in parallele. D is the output.

#### Example 4: Simple Loop Construction

`A → B → A`  
This defines a constructive cycle between A and B and back to A. It is a **potential loop**—infinite and non-terminal.

#### Example 5: Larger Loop Construction

`A → B → C → A`  
Means A loops to A but it goes through B and C sequentially until it circles back to A. No resolution.

#### Example 6: Larger Loop Construction

`A → B → A ∧ A → C → A`  
Means A loops to A but it goes through B and C in parallele until it circles back to A. No resolution.

---

#### 2. **Translation into Static**

#### Example 1: Simple Translation 

`A → B ~ A ▷ B`  
This is a **static outcome**. No cycle is implied.

#### Example 2: Single Path Translation

`A → B → C → D ~ A ▷ D : (B ∧ C)`  
Means A becomes D via B and C.

#### Example 3: Multiple Path Translation

`A → B → D ∧ A → C → D ~ A ▷ D : (B ∨ C)`   
Means A becomes D via B or C.

#### Example 4: Simple Loop Translation

`A → B → A ~ A ⟳ A : B`  
This becomes a **loop structure**, statically defined as “A loops to A via B.”

#### Example 5: Larger Loop Translation

`A → B → C → A ~ A ⟳ A : (B ∧ C)`  
Means A loops to A via B and C.

#### Example 6: Larger Loop Translation

`A → B → A ∧ A → C → A ~ A ⟳ A : (B ∨ C)`  
Means A loops to A via B or C.

---

#### 3. **Collapse Operator**

Evaluates whether a structure allows **external logical resolution**.

| Structure                  | Collapse Result |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| `A ▷ B`                   | `true`           |
| `A ⟳ A : B`               | `false`          |

Collapse is **Boolean** and applies only after translation.

#### Example

`A ▷ B ↓ true`

`A ⟳ A : B ↓ false`

---

#### 4. Structural Equality

Use `≣` to compare static constructs:

`A ⟳ A : B ≣ C ⟳ C : D` 
- True if structures are form-identical.
- Applies only after translation; structure-only, not resolution-based.

---

### 🧮 Loop Constraints

#### ✅ Valid Parallel Loops

- `A ⟳ A : B ∧ C ⟳ C : D`  
Parallel, distinct, and analyzable.

#### ❌ Invalid (Nested or Obscured Loops)

- `A ⟳ (C ⟳ C : D)`  
Nesting obscures structure and breaks static visibility.

---

### 🧩 Types of Structures

In *The No Theory*, all entities are classified based on their internal contradiction and structural relation to logic. These types reflect the static role a structure plays in the system:

---

#### 1. **Ultimate Impossibility (`Ω`)**

- The boundary of all logic and static analysis.  
- Internally contains infinite unresolved contradiction.  
- It is **externally real** (referable), but internally unstructured by logic.  
- No structure can surpass or resolve `Ω`.

---

#### 2. **Proper Paradox**

- A structure that contains an **irreducible contradiction**.  
- Forms a **closed static loop** with no internal resolution or collapse `↓`.  
- It **belongs to** `Ω`, but is not equal to it.  
- No logic can be exported without interaction.

- Example:  
  `A ⟳ A : B`  
  where `B` creates contradiction and `A` cannot resolve.

---

#### 3. **Composite Paradox**

- A structure that includes a **proper paradox** and **logical components**.  
- This allows **partial resolution** or **conditional collapse `↓`**.  
- Composite paradoxes may resolve depending on how internal contradiction is shaped by external logic.

- Example:  
  `P ∧ L` where `P` is a proper paradox and `L` is logically coherent.

---

#### 4. **Logical Structure**

- A structure with **no internal contradiction**.  
- Fully reducible and capable of exporting collapse `↓` by static translation.

- Example:  
  `A → B → C ~ A ▷ C : B`  
  Clear construction path with no paradox.

---

This classification defines the full spectrum of structural behavior. Structures do not tend toward infinite growth. Instead, **many paradoxes simplify, collapse, or loop** depending on interaction and static form.

---

### 📌 Notes

- **Static analysis** is non-computational.
- Collapse is Boolean (`true` or `false`).
- Proper paradoxes are structurally defined, not errors.
- Use `∧` and `∨` for combining structures in parallel or disjunctive ways.
