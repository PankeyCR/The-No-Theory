### 🔣 Symbol System

| Symbol | Name                        | Description |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `→`    | Tends To                    | Dynamic construction from A to B. |
| `~`    | Translation                 | Converts dynamic structure into static form. |
| `▷`    | Becomes                     | Specifies a definite result. |
| `⟳`    | Static Loop                 | Denotes a circular relationship. |
| `:`    | Via                         | Used in static loops: A loops to A via B. |
| `↓`    | Collapse                    | Boolean: structure allows external logic export. |
| `≣`    | Structural Equality         | Static structure comparison. |
| `∧`    | And                         | Parallel composition of structures. |
| `∨`    | Or                          | Disjunctive structural option. |
| `¬`    | Not                         | Negation. |
| `∈`    | Belongs To                  | Membership. |

### 🧮 Core Operations

#### 1. **Dynamic Construction**

#### Example 1: Simple Construction  
`A → B`  
Means A tends to B through a dynamic process. B is the generated output.

#### Example 2: Loop Construction
`A → B → A`  
This defines a constructive cycle between A and B and back to A. It is a **potential loop**—infinite and non-terminal.

---

#### 2. **Translation into Static**

#### Example 1: One-way Construction  
`A → B ~ A ▷ B`  
This is a **static outcome**. No cycle is implied.

#### Case 2: Cyclic Construction  
`A → B → A ~ A ⟳ A : B`  
This becomes a **loop structure**, statically defined as “A loops to A via B.”

---

#### 3. **Proper Paradox**

#### Form  
`A ⟳ A : B` where A loops to A and passes through B.  
This is a **self-referential structure**. It does not resolve, but is statically constructible.

- `A → B ~ A ▷ B` — **Not a paradox**.
- `A → B → A ~ A ⟳ A : B` — **Proper paradox**.

---

#### 4. **Collapse Operator**

Evaluates whether a structure allows **external logical resolution**.

| Structure                  | Collapse Result |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| `A ▷ B`                   | `true`           |
| `A ⟳ A : B`               | `false`          |

Collapse is **Boolean** and applies only after translation.

#### Example 
`A ▷ B ↓ true`
`A ⟳ A : B ↓ false`

---

### 🧮 Loop Constraints

#### ✅ Valid Parallel Loops

- `A ⟳ A : B ∧ C ⟳ C : D`  
Parallel, distinct, and analyzable.

#### ❌ Invalid (Nested or Obscured Loops)

- `A ⟳ (C ⟳ C : D)`  
Nesting obscures structure and breaks static visibility.

---

### ♻️ Structural Equality

Use `≣` to compare static constructs:

- `A ⟳ A : B ≣ C ⟳ C : D` → true if structures are form-identical.
- Applies only after translation; structure-only, not resolution-based.

---

### 📌 Notes

- **Static analysis** is non-computational.
- Collapse is Boolean (`true` or `false`).
- Proper paradoxes are structurally defined, not errors.
- Use `∧` and `∨` for combining structures in parallel or disjunctive ways.
