## Consciousness

**Status**: Under Development  
**Role**: Defines what consciousness is and how the self arises, and eventually how logic and thoughts emerge.

### Consciousness as Structural Paradox

Consciousness is not computational. It is a projection that arises from a fundamental contradiction: the experience of life appears to occur outside the body, yet it is processed and internalized entirely within the brain.

This contradiction does not collapse. It remains unresolved. It forms what is defined in this theory as a proper paradox — a stable contradiction that has no internal resolution, but that can still be referenced. We can say “there is consciousness,” but we cannot extract any logical statement from consciousness itself. It is an entity that can be bounded and named, but not analyzed internally by logic.

Consciousness is thus a persistent projection — a static impossibility that loops the external world into an internal space. It is not reducible, not computable, and not directly accessible through logic. However, it forms the container from which secondary projections can emerge.

We define consciousness as the projection of the external world made inside the brain and projected outside again:

`C = E ⟳ E : I`

Where:

- **C** is consciousness.
- **E** is the external world — unknowable raw data, only accessible through inputs.
- **I** is the internal perceptual model — the brain’s construction from sensory input.
