### üß© Introduction to Static Analisys

Static analysis comes as a need to stop trying to compute an illogic statement. You can drag yourself down the rabbit hole with any illogic and get nowhere. But when you stop the computation, there‚Äôs a chance to see it as it is and have another perspective. This is where this theory comes to be.

Not resolving the illogic is the answer in some sense. The new perspective clarifies that we are talking or thinking about something, but somehow it‚Äôs impossible to resolve it. So there‚Äôs something about it that makes it not capable of being resolved, so there‚Äôs a structure or form that explains this impossibility of resolution. This gives the idea that illogics are impossible things but still things.

Since illogics have shapes or structure, we can talk about them. And this structure points to an illogic even if we can‚Äôt resolve them.

When you‚Äôre down the rabbit hole thinking about an illogic, and you stop, the train of thought collapses into a structure. This is the process in which static analysis in our brains starts. The collapse of an illogic into a structure is done without time; it‚Äôs actually time that makes us miss the opportunity to see the structure as it is.

The act of simply observing the illogic as it is, is called static analysis.

### üß© Types of Structures

The only means to create an illogic is to force a logic into itself because it is the only way we can refer to something. That gives us a limit to how many illogics we can construct, even if there are more illogics than logics.

For every type of logic we can form an illogic, and this gives rise to different types of illogic, each with different structures.

The first way of differentiating structure is by the way of viewing it. It can seem stationary or cyclic. But the elegant way to use it is by the cyclic approach. This cyclic interpretation can be formed by a tendency or chain in sequence. This tendency is also how to transform the stationary description into the cyclic.

The types of structure come from the ways you can arrange a cycle:

- How many steps it takes to complete a cycle.  
- How many paths it can take.  
- How many return points it has.

All the forms it can have are a different type of illogic.

### üß© Cardinality

The cardinality comes from the second act of abstraction, first from the elements in the cycle, an second from the order of the cycle. Each element is separeted by the tends to operator.

`| A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D | = 4`  

When the cycle is form, the cardinality becomes transfinite, but the type of structure determines the diferent size of it.

`| A ‚ü≥ A | = ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : B | = 2‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : ( B ‚àß C ) | = 3‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  

This is how the countable cycles grow in cardinality. Since the loop takes more to complete, the growth if bigger. It might look that it has the same size as the totality of the natural numbers but the natural numbers only can be constructed as a trivial loop and not as something more.

`A ‚àà A ~ A ‚ü≥ A`  

And if A is an unit.

`A = 1`  

Then A loops to A contains all units that can be and the cardinality is ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ.

Now we can define cardinality to other types of structures:

`| A ‚ü≥ A : ( B ‚à® C ) | = 2‚ÇÄ^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : ( B ‚à® C ‚à® D ) | = 3‚ÇÄ^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  

These are uncountable loops because theres no order in wich it can loop and the totality is bigger then ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ but not bigger then X‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ been X‚ÇÄ any value exept ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ since that will be another type of structure.  

Cardinality can be seen as a one to one corespondence between to structures but the way you pair them matters to, if one element of an structure is place with two elements of another structure, the second will grow faster, if you get infinite time to pair them you still get more of the second even if the first can get to the size of the second. This way of understaning it is mearly computational.  
Static analisys have an easier way to analise transfinite operations by structure. When you create a cycle, you¬¥ve already set a transfinite structure and its infinity is set by the cycle been eternal but by adding more elements to the chain, that eternal loop gets bigger, simple as that.
