### üß© Introduction to Static Analisys

Static analisys comes as a need to stop trying to compute an illogic statement, you can drag your self to the rabit hole with any illogic and get nowhere. But when to stop the computation theres a chance to see as it is an have another perpective. This is where this theory comes to be.

Not resolving the illogic is the answer in some sense, the new perpective clarifies that we are talking or thinking about something but some how its imposible to resolve it. So theres someting about it that makes it no capable of resolving, so theres a structure or form thats explain this imposibility of resolution. This gives the idea that illogics are imposible things but still things.

Sense illogics have shapes or structure, we can talk about them. An this structure points to an illogics even if we can¬¥t resolve them. 

When your down the rabit hole thinking about an illogic, and you stop, the train of thougth collapses into an structure, this is the process in wich static analisys in our brains start. The collapse of an illogic into a structure is done without time, its actually time the one making us miss the oportunity to see the structure as it is.

The act of simply observing the illogic as it is, is called static analisys.

### üß© Types of Structures

The only means to create an illogic is to force a logic into itself because is the only way we can refer to something, that gives us a limit to how many illogics we can construct, even if theres more illogic then logics.

For every type of logic we can form an illogic, and this give rise to diferents types of illogic, each with diferent structures. 

The first way of diferentiating structure is by stationary and cyclic.
