### üß© Introduction to Static Analisys

Static analisys comes as a need to stop trying to compute an illogic statement, you can drag your self to the rabit hole with any illogic and get nowhere. But when to stop the computation theres a chance to see as it is an have another perpective. This is where this theory comes to be.

Not resolving the illogic is the answer in some sense, the new perpective clarifies that we are talking or thinking about something but some how its imposible to resolve it. So theres someting about it that makes it no capable of resolving, so theres a structure or form thats explain this imposibility of resolution. This gives the idea that illogics are imposible things but still things.

Sense illogics have shapes or structure, we can talk about them. An this structure points to an illogics even if we can¬¥t resolve them. 

When your down the rabit hole thinking about an illogic, and you stop, the train of thougth collapses into an structure, this is the process in wich static analisys in our brains start. The collapse of an illogic into a structure is done without time, its actually time the one making us miss the oportunity to see the structure as it is.

The act of simply observing the illogic as it is, is called static analisys.

### üß© Types of Structures

The only means to create an illogic is to force a logic into itself because is the only way we can refer to something, that gives us a limit to how many illogics we can construct, even if theres more illogic then logics.

For every type of logic we can form an illogic, and this give rise to diferents types of illogic, each with diferent structures. 

The first way of diferentiating structure is by the way of viewing it, it can seems stationary or cyclic. But the elegant way to use it is by the cyclic aproche. This cyclic interpretation can be form by a tendency or chain in sequence. This tendency is also how to transform the stationary description into the cyclic.

The types of structure comes for the ways you can arrange a cycle: 
-how many steps it takes to complete a cicle.
-how many path it can take.
-how many return point does it have.

All the forms it can have its a diferent type of illogic.

### üß© Cardinality

The cardinality comes from the second act of abstraction, first from the elements in the cycle, an second from the order of the cycle. Each element is separeted by the tends to operator.

`| A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D | = 4`  

When the cycle is form, the cardinality becomes transfinite, but the type of structure determines the diferent size of it.

`| A ‚ü≥ A | = ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ` 
`| A ‚ü≥ A : B | = 2‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : ( B ‚àß C ) | = 3‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ` 

This is how the countable cycles grow in cardinality. Since the loop takes more to complete, the growth if bigger. It might look that it has the same size as the totality of the natural numbers but the natural numbers only can be constructed as a trivial loop and not as something more.

`A ‚àà A ~ A ‚ü≥ A`  

And if A is an unit.

`A = 1`  

Then A loops to A contains all units that can be and the cardinality is ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ.

Now we can define cardinality to other types of structures:

`| A ‚ü≥ A : ( B ‚à® C ) | = 2‚ÇÄ^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`
