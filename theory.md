### üß© Types of Structures

In *The No Theory*, all entities are classified based on their internal contradiction and structural relation to logic. These types reflect the static role a structure plays in the system:

---

#### 1. **Ultimate Impossibility (`Œ©`)**

- The boundary of all logic and static analysis.  
- Internally contains infinite unresolved contradiction.  
- It is **externally real** (referable), but internally unstructured by logic.  
- No structure can surpass or resolve `Œ©`.

---

#### 2. **Proper Paradox**

- A structure that contains an **irreducible contradiction**.  
- Forms a **closed static loop** with no internal resolution or collapse `‚Üì`.  
- It **belongs to** `Œ©`, but is not equal to it.  
- No logic can be exported without interaction.

- Example:  
  `A ‚ü≥ A : B`  
  where `B` creates contradiction and `A` cannot resolve.

---

#### 3. **Composite Paradox**

- A structure that includes a **proper paradox** and **logical components**.  
- This allows **partial resolution** or **conditional collapse `‚Üì`**.  
- Composite paradoxes may resolve depending on how internal contradiction is shaped by external logic.

- Example:  
  `P ‚àß L` where `P` is a proper paradox and `L` is logically coherent.

---

#### 4. **Logical Structure**

- A structure with **no internal contradiction**.  
- Fully reducible and capable of exporting collapse `‚Üì` by static translation.

- Example:  
  `A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ~ A ‚ñ∑ C : B`  
  Clear construction path with no paradox.

---

This classification defines the full spectrum of structural behavior. Structures do not tend toward infinite growth. Instead, **many paradoxes simplify, collapse, or loop** depending on interaction and static form.
