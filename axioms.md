## 📐 Axioms: Basis of the Ideas regarding imposibilities 

**Status**: Under Development  
**Role**: It gives the underlying notions for how imposibilities work and how logic arise from them

## Axioms:

## Axiom 1 — Ultimate Impossibility (Ω)
There exists a unique entity Ω such that:

It contains all proper paradoxes.

It is internally completely illogical and infinitely contradictory.

It is externally real, bounded by a final logical reference.

Ω ∈ Ω

## Axiom 2 — Paradox Containment
If x ∈ Ω and x ≠ Ω, then x is a proper paradox.

## Axiom 3 — Existence Through Resolution
∀x ( x | x ¬∈ Ω ∧ x ≠ Ω)
If something is not the ultimate impossibility or a proper paradox, then its something logical that can be talk about and compute
