# Why Static Analysis Is Non-Computable

The No Theory is not a computational theory. It does not rely on sequences of steps to reach conclusions, nor does it define existence or truth via proof procedures or derivations. Instead, it introduces a static analytical framework where **the result is already embedded in the structure** of the object being analyzed.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Differences

| Aspect               | Computation (Turing)                          | Static Analysis (The No Theory)                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Process              | Step-by-step evaluation                       | Instant recognition of structure                        |
| Time Dependency      | Temporally extended (multiple operations)     | Timeless (one act of structural recognition)            |
| Goal                 | Find result through procedure                 | Realize result as part of object                        |
| Example              | Solve equation via iterations                 | Identify contradiction embedded in a paradox            |

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It's Not Computable

- Computation implies **resolution over time**; static analysis implies **immediate collapse or recognition**.
- A paradox does not require steps to be resolved; it is **recognized** as unresolvable by its **structure**.
- Realness, impossibility, and contradiction are not outcomesâ€”they are **states** inherent to certain formations.

## ðŸš« No Turing Machine Can Perform Static Analysis

A Turing Machine can simulate finite derivations but cannot analyze an object that **contains its own contradiction** without infinite looping or failure.  
The No Theory classifies such objects not by solving them but by **statically identifying** their form.

> Static analysis is not undecidable; it is **non-computable** because it does not belong to the domain of computation at all.
